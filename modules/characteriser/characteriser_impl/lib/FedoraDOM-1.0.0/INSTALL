== INSTALL ==


The object planets:PlanetsContentModelContentModel must exist in the repository. This is the content model for
planets content models, sort of a class for classes.

Then, one or more planets content models must exist in the repository. One such object has been included,
planets:ContentModel_FileObject. The planets:PlanetsContentModelContentModel must reference one planets content model.
At the moment, it references planets:ContentModel_FileObject.

Planets content models must have a datastream called "PLANETS". It should have the information about how a fedora object
should be mapped to a planets object. The schema for this has been included, and is called PlanetsDatastreamSchema.xsd.
A sample planets datastream have also been included.

The content of the exported objects are a API-A-Lite reference to the content datastream in the data objects. So, if
the repository require authentication to access these datastreams, it will be impossible to read the contents of the
planets objects afterwards.

When this setup have been done, the system should be ready to use.
