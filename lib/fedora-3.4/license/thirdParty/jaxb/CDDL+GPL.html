<p>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this nse document, but changing it is not allowed.
</p>

<p><b>Preamble</b></p>

<p>
    The licenses for most software are designed to tak y your
    freedom to

har  change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
        free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
    This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's soft

re  o any other program whose authors commit
        to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered
    by the GNU Lib General Public License instead.) You can apply it
        to your progra oo.
    </p>

    <p>
    When we speak of free software, we are referri  freedom, not


ice  General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you ha e freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
        charge fo s service if you wish), that you receive source c

e
   can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
     ieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
    d se things.
</p>

    <p>
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
        rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
    for you if you distribut

cop f the software, or if you modify it.
</p>

<p>
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you m ive the recipients all the rights
    that you have. You must mak e that they, too, receive or can get
    the source code. And you m how them these terms so they know
    their rights.
</p>

    <p>
    We

ote ur rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
    and  ffer you this license whi

 gives you legal permission to
        copy, distribute and/or modify the softwar
.
< p>

<p>
    Also, for each author's protection and ou
s, wt trtain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for e
    software. If the software is modified by someone else and p
    we want its recipients to know that what they have is not  nal,
    so that any problems introduced by others will not refle
    original authors' reputations.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, any f am is threatened constantly by software patents.
        We wish to e danger that redistributors of a free program will
        individua n patent licenses, in effect making the program
    proprietary. T  this, we have made it clear that any patent
    must be license ryone's free use or not license all.
