    should
    do so in a manner which do t create potential liability for other

    commercial
    product offering, such Contribu "Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees
        to
    defend and indemnify

ery othe  Contributor (

ndemnifi d Contributor")
    against
    any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
    lawsuits and other legal ons brough a third party against the
    Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused he  or omissions of
    such
        Commercial Contributor in connection w ts distribution of the Program in
    a
    commercial product offering. The obligations i s section do not apply to
    any
    claims or Losses relating to any actua alleged intellectual property
        infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified ributor must: a)
    promptly
    notify the Commercial Contributo writing of  claim, and b) allow the
    Commercial Co

ributor  o control, and coop rate with the Commercial
