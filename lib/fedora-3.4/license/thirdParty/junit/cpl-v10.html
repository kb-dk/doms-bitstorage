    While this license is intended t ilitate the commercial use of the
    Program, the Contributor who includes Program in a commercial product
    offering should do so in a ma which does not create potential liability
    for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in
    a commercial product ring, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")
    hereby agrees to d

end and  ndemnify every o

er Contr butor ("Indemnified
    Contributor") against any losses, damages  osts (collectively "Losses")
        arising from claims, lawsuits and r legal actions brought by a third
    party against the Indemnif ontributor to the extent caused by the acts
    or omissions of such ercial Contributor in connection with its
    distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
    obligations in this section do apply to any claims or Losses relating to
    any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to
        qualify, an Indemnifie tributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
    Contributor in writing uch claim, and b) allow t

 Commerc al
    Contributor to control, and cooperate with the

mmercial Contribu or in,
    the defense and a y related settlem egotiations. The In

    performance claims, or offers warran ies relat  Product X, those
    performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
    res onsibility alone. Under this sec ion, the Commercial Contributor would
    have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
            performance claims and warranties, and if a court ires any other
    Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commerci ntributor must
    pa  those damages.</FONT>
